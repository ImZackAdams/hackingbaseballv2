= SPEC-001: Baseball Game Outcome Prediction and Betting Odds Web App
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This project is conceived as a brand-new venture aimed at creating an MVP web application that provides predictive outcomes for baseball games coupled with real-time betting odds comparison across various sportsbooks. Initially targeting baseball sports betting enthusiasts, the service is designed to start small with a robust, scalable architecture utilizing a Flask and scikit-learn stack for predictive modeling and Bootstrap for the front end.

== Requirements

The web application shall prioritize requirements as follows:

*Must have:*
- A predictive model for baseball game outcomes.
- A payment processing system to handle transactions.
- Immediate display of predictions after payment.

*Should have:*
- Real-time retrieval of betting odds.
- User privacy and transaction security measures.

*Could have:*
- Responsive front-end for various devices.
- Admin panel for schedule and transaction management.

*Wonâ€™t have for now:*
- User account registration and login.
- Advanced analytics of user predictions.

== Method

=== Architecture Overview
The application will adopt a Modular Monolithic architecture with distinct modules within a single codebase to facilitate rapid development and easier maintenance:

*Front-end*: A responsive SPA built with Bootstrap.
*Back-end*: Flask serves as the backbone, handling API requests and integrating modules.
*Database*: SQLite managed through SQLAlchemy, with modular tables for different domains.
*Modules*: Include Data Collection/Cleaning, Prediction, Game Management, Payment Processing, and Odds Comparison.

=== Machine Learning Model Integration
The model updates daily to reflect new game data, ensuring accuracy with minimal latency.

=== Payment Processing Flow
Utilizes Stripe for secure transaction processing with real-time updates to the application upon payment confirmation.

=== Result Display
Post-payment, predictions and odds are displayed instantly, leveraging AJAX for dynamic content updates.

=== Betting Odds Retrieval
Regular updates from sportsbooks are implemented via scheduled tasks.

== Implementation

=== Quick Launch Strategy
The strategy focuses on rapid development cycles, prioritized feature development, and robust testing practices:

1. **Core Module Development**: Start with essential modules (Prediction, Payment).
2. **Front-End Development**: Simultaneously develop the front-end to speed up the feedback cycle.
3. **Integration and Testing**: Early and continuous integration of components, with a focus on automated testing.

=== Condensed Development Phases
1. **Module Development**: Rapid development of independent modules with dedicated teams.
2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for real-time testing and deployment.
3. **Daily Stand-Ups**: Increase communication to track progress and address issues promptly.
4. **Flexible Work Hours**: Encourage flexible hours to maximize productivity across remote teams.
