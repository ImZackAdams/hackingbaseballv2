= SPEC-001: Baseball Game Outcome Prediction and Betting Odds Web App
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This project is conceived as a brand-new venture aimed at creating an MVP web application that provides predictive outcomes for baseball games coupled with real-time betting odds comparison across various sportsbooks. Initially, the service targets the niche of baseball sports betting enthusiasts with the intention to scale up progressively. The application currently features a simple yet functional machine learning model built with scikit-learn and a web page that displays the daily schedule of games, developed using the Flask framework and Bootstrap for the front end.

== Requirements

The MVP of the web application shall have the following requirements, prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

*Must have:*
- A machine learning model to predict the outcomes of baseball games.
- A payment processing system to handle transactions without user account creation.
- Display the prediction results for the purchased baseball game(s) immediately after payment.

*Should have:*
- Real-time retrieval of betting odds from various sportsbooks to be displayed alongside predictions.
- A method to ensure privacy and anonymity for users.
- Adequate security measures to protect transaction data.

*Could have:*
- A responsive front-end design that adapts to various devices.
- An admin panel for the web app owner to manage game schedules and view transactions.

*Wonâ€™t have for now:*
- User account management features such as registration and login.
- Advanced user analytics or prediction history.

== Method

=== Architecture Overview
The system will be developed as a modular monolith, structured to enable a small team to manage and understand the codebase effectively. This approach will allow for easy separation of concerns within the application while avoiding the complexity of a distributed microservices architecture.

*Front-end*: A single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the Flask back-end via API calls. The user interface will be built using Bootstrap for a responsive design.

*Back-end*: A Flask application organized into separate modules representing different business logic domains such as user authentication, prediction processing, game management, payment processing, and odds comparison.

*Database*: SQLite will be utilized as the database solution, given its simplicity and ease of integration with Flask. Each module will interact with the database through a common ORM layer.

*Modules*: Each module will be designed to operate independently, with clear interfaces for interaction with other modules in the system.

=== Machine Learning Model Integration
The machine learning model will be updated daily with new data to ensure predictions reflect the latest player and game statistics. A separate module within the Flask app will handle the training, updating, and prediction tasks of the model.

=== Payment Processing Flow
The payment module will integrate with a third-party payment processor, such as Stripe, to handle transactions. It will interface with the front-end to initiate payment and return confirmation once the transaction is completed.

=== Result Display
After a successful transaction, the predictions module will be invoked to provide real-time predictions to the user, along with the betting odds information from the odds comparison module.

=== Betting Odds Retrieval
A scheduled task within the odds comparison module will regularly update betting odds data from various sportsbooks.

== Implementation

=== Implementation Approach
Given the team's size and experience level, the implementation will focus on incremental development with a high degree of collaboration and regular code reviews. The use of a virtual environment and version control (Git) will be essential to manage dependencies and changes.

=== Development Stages
1. Module implementation will start with the most critical functions (user authentication, predictions, and payment processing).
2. The application will be developed and tested locally, with regular commits to a shared repository for collaboration.
3. Upon achieving a stable version with core functionality, the application will be deployed to a cloud hosting provider such as PythonAnywhere for real-world testing.

=== Testing and Quality Assurance
A testing suite will be established early in development to ensure that each module functions correctly both independently and within the context of the larger application. Automated tests will be integrated into the development pipeline.

== Milestones

The project milestones will be divided into two-week sprints, each focusing on a set of deliverables corresponding to the modules of the application. The final milestone will culminate in the launch of the application.

Milestone 1: **Core Module Development**
- Development of the prediction and payment processing modules.
- Deadline: 2 weeks from project start.

Milestone 2: **Additional Modules and Front-end Integration**
- Development of the game management and odds comparison modules.
- Integration of the front-end with the back-end modules.
- Deadline: 4 weeks from project start.

Milestone 3: **Testing and Iteration**
- Comprehensive testing of all modules.
- Iterative improvements based on test results.
- Deadline: 6 weeks from project start.

Milestone 4: **Deployment and Launch**
- Deployment of the full application stack on the hosting platform.
- Final testing and launch of the application.
- Deadline: 8 weeks from project start.
