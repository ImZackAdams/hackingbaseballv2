= SPEC-001: Baseball Game Outcome Prediction and Betting Odds Web App
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This project is conceived as a brand-new venture aimed at creating an MVP web application that provides predictive outcomes for baseball games coupled with real-time betting odds comparison across various sportsbooks. The application is designed to start small with scalable architecture, utilizing Flask and scikit-learn for predictive modeling, and Bootstrap for the front-end.

== Requirements

The web application’s requirements are organized using the MoSCoW method:

*Must have:*
- A predictive model for baseball game outcomes.
- A payment processing system to handle transactions.
- Immediate display of predictions and odds after payment.

*Should have:*
- Real-time retrieval of betting odds.
- User privacy and transaction security measures.

*Could have:*
- Responsive front-end for various devices.
- Admin panel for schedule and transaction management.

*Won’t have for now:*
- User account registration and login.
- Advanced analytics of user predictions.

== Method

=== Architecture Overview
The application will adopt a Modular Monolithic architecture with distinct modules within a single codebase. This facilitates rapid development, easier maintenance, and effective scaling as needed:

*Front-end*: A responsive SPA built with Bootstrap.
*Back-end*: Flask serves as the backbone, handling API requests and integrating various modules.
*Database*: SQLite managed through SQLAlchemy, organized into modular tables for different domains.
*Modules*: Include Prediction, Payment Processing, Game Management, Odds Comparison, and Result Display.

=== Module Interactions
Each module has specific roles and interacts with others to ensure a seamless flow of data and functionality:

- **Prediction Module**: Handles all machine learning predictions. Interacts with the Game Management Module to obtain necessary game data and sends prediction results to the Result Display Module.
- **Payment Processing Module**: Manages financial transactions. Notifies the Result Display Module upon successful payment to trigger the display of predictions and odds.
- **Game Management Module**: Manages game-related data. Provides necessary details to the Prediction Module for generating accurate predictions.
- **Odds Comparison Module**: Fetches and compares betting odds from various sportsbooks. Supplies updated odds information to the Result Display Module for display alongside predictions.
- **Result Display Module**: Controls the user interface elements for presenting results. Receives data from both the Prediction and Odds Comparison Modules to display to users post-payment.

=== Detailed Module Descriptions
Each module’s responsibilities and interactions are defined to clarify their roles within the system:

*Prediction Module*:
- Fetches game data from the Game Management Module.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes.
- Sends predictions to the Result Display Module for user display.

*Payment Processing Module*:
- Integrates with Stripe to process user transactions securely.
- Upon successful payment, signals the Result Display Module to update the user interface with results.

*Game Management Module*:
- Maintains schedules and details of baseball games.
- Provides the Prediction Module with required data for analysis.

*Odds Comparison Module*:
- Regularly updates odds from multiple sportsbooks.
- Provides current odds to the Result Display Module for display.

*Result Display Module*:
- Receives predictions and odds data.
- Displays this information dynamically on the user interface following a successful payment.

...

== Implementation

=== Development Strategy
To ensure timely delivery within the 8-week timeframe, the development strategy emphasizes parallel module development, continuous integration, and automated testing:

1. **Core Module Development**: Priority development of the Prediction and Payment Processing modules.
2. **Front-End Development**: Concurrent development of the user interface to align with backend progress.
3. **Integration and Testing**: Continuous integration of all components, with extensive automated testing to ensure system integrity and performance.
